# What is open source?
  
  _what do you think open source means?_
  
## Some of the things open source isn't

### Open source isn't just any code shared on the internet. 
Code on GitHub (or anywhere public) without a licence is actually copyrighted and can't be re-used. The only way to make your code open source is to explicitly add a licence, or potentially to upload it to a site that automatically provides an open licence (example: figshare does this). 

### Free software
![open source and free software overlap but aren't the same](chart.svg)
Sometimes open source software is free (as in it doesn't cost you money to use), and sometimes free software is open source, but they are not the same thing. 

- Open access vs data vs source. 
  - "free as in beer" vs "free as in speech" may come up here...
  - discuss licencing, loosely (e.g. strong vs weak copyleft and why this is important)
