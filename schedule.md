# Open Source Workshop

## 28 November 2018

**Registration and event details:** https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/introduction-to-open-source-tickets-51296881353 

Are you a researcher who writes code for your work, and would like to learn more about better software practises in open source software? This workshop will teach you the basics of version control using Git and GitHub. Once we're comfortable using Git to commit, pull, and push code, we'll discuss the basics of a good quality open source project. Finally, we'll work together on a collaborative repository to get experience working collaboratively on GitHub, and making your first steps towards contributing towards open source.
