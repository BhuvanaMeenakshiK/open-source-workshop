# What makes an open source project good and useful?

Open source your own project (or tune up a project that's already open):

  - If you only have a few lines of code, maybe a git [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or somewhere else like [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) might be easier than a git repo.
  - **Avoid jargon**, or at least expand it into plain english if possible. Challenge: Can you explain your project using only the [ten hundred most used words?](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/)
  - **Readme files**. Create a readme.md file to explain what your project is, how it is used, and how to contribute and report bugs. readme.md is the file that is automatically displayed when you open a GitHub repo.
  - **Roadmap** - a roadmap file allows others to see what you have planned in the future, and helps you to set priorities.
  - **Contributing guide** - make a file called CONTRIBUTING.md and guidelines for contributors so they know what they should do if they want to help you out.
  - **Issues** - use GitHub issues to record your bugs and planned new features. GitHub tags can make it easy to sort the issues.
  - **Code of Conduct!** - good projects have codes of conduct to make sure that people are treated well, and state how violations will be handled. Github has an [Code of Conduct wizard](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/) to make it easy to add one.
  - You've been creating scientific software, so you deserve some credit! Add citation guidelines to a recent/relevant paper if you have one. You can also add a [cff (citation file format) file](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format), or get a DOI for your repo using [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
