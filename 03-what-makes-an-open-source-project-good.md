Open source your own project (or tune up a project that's already open) - largely inspired by Mozilla materials

  - If you only have a few lines of code, maybe a git [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or somewhere else like [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) might be easier than a git repo.
  - Avoid jargon
  - Readme
  - Roadmap
  - Contributing guide
  - Issues, well tagged
  - Code of Conduct!
  - How to cite my brilliant software
