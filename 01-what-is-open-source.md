# What is open source?

  _what do you think open source means?_

## Some of the things open source isn't

### Open source isn't just any code shared on the internet.
Code on GitHub (or anywhere public) without a licence is actually copyrighted and can't be re-used. The only way to make your code open source is to explicitly add a licence, or potentially to upload it to a site that automatically provides an open licence (example: figshare does this).

### Open source isn't free software
![open source and free software overlap but aren't the same](chart.svg)
Sometimes open source software is free (as in it doesn't cost you money to use), and sometimes free software is open source, but they are not the same thing.

## So what _is_ open source?

Open Source is simply sharing the design for your work so it can be re-used and re-mixed by others.

### Open access vs data vs source.

Time for a bit of disambiguation.

- **Open access** usually refers to _papers_ that aren't paywalled by publishers.
- **Open data** refers to the practice of sharing the data that produces your results. This is especially important if you write code that depends in the data - the code can't usually be re-run without it.
- **Open source** shared design for your work that can be re-used by others, often computer code or hardware designs.

## Open source glossary

Here are some popular terms that may crop up when talking about open source.

- "free as in beer" vs "free as in speech": some software is free like beer (doesn't cost money) and some software is free like speech (no-one can tell you what to do with the software).  Some are both, or neither.
- Copyleft: coined as an opposite of copyright, copyleft is the concept that software _must_ remain free (open) according to its licence terms.
- FLOSS or F/LOSS: Free / Libre Open Source software.

### Why open source?
- Hacker ethic - nobody should have to reinvent the wheel. If you have benefitted from other’s work, you should give back to the community
- Distributed collaborative innovation: share your work, and others will share back
- Open source makes interdisciplinarity easier
- Decentralisation, appropriation and customisation
- Document for others and for you: If you include documentation to help others set it up, it’ll be easier for you to come back to the project when you’ve forgotten what you did.

## Licencing

There are lots of open source licences out there. Most are pretty good. Use one!
Some allow users of the code to do anything they like with their code - these are known as permissive licences. Examples are the [MIT Licence](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) or [Apache](https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0)).

Here are some ways to help you choose:
