Open Scientific Code using Git and GitHub  

A collection of explanations and short practical exercises to help researchers learn more about version control and open source software.

1. [What is open source?](01-what-is-open-source)
    - Define open source vs. free software, discuss licencing.
2. [What is version control?](02-what-is-version-control)
    - Define version control & discuss it purpose.  
3. Practical exercises with Git & GitHub
    - [Practical exercise: Let's get started with Git](practicalexercises/github/01-how-to-start-contributing-to-open-source)
