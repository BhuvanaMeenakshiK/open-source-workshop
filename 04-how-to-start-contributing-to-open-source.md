# How to start contributing to another project

A good way to learn about working with git and open source projects is to contribute to someone else's project yourself. Here are a few ways to get started.

- Go to your favourite project libraries and look for guides.
- Try the [first-timers-only](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Afirst-timers-only&state=open&type=Issues) tag on GitHub, or visit [firsttimersonly.com](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
- Participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) (October), the [Mozilla Global Sprint](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/) (May), and/or [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/) (December).
- Students only: Participate in [Google Summer of Code].
