# What is version control?

  Hands up - _who has heard of version control software?_  
  _What do you think it does?_

## Version control software

Version control software allows you to effectively "save" your work at important
 points in time and come back to any of the save points.

## Some popular options:

- GitHub https://github.com/
- BitBucket [https://bitbucket.org/](https://bitbucket.org/)
- GitLab [https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com)

## WHY use it?

- never mess up again.
- okay - you _will_ still mess up, but it means you can recover your mistakes.
- it makes collaborating on code much easier
- it provides offsite backups (so long as you push your work to a remote server). We've all heard stories of people who had their hard-drives corrupted or computers stolen before. With Git (or other version control) this never needs to happen again!
