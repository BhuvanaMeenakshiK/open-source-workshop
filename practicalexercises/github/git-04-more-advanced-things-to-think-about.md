# Extra things to try

##Â Reverts
Imagine you've made a mistake, and committed something you didn't intend to - maybe code that broke everything, or you added a file you didn't intend to add. You can revert commits - in GitHub Desktop, try right clicking on the commit in the history panel.

## Ignore files
Sometimes there are files you don't want to commit to your repository. Examples might the the `.DS_Store` file automatically generated on Mac systems, or autosave backup files that some text generators add.  //TODO ADD DETAILS
