# Group Exercise - thinking about open source

##Â Working openly with software and data: pros, cons, and pondering points.

   - Break up into groups of 4-5, and take 2-3 cards from the [Open To Discussion](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/commit/7379a27aef4b3d5ba28b6eba79f5b5f9ad549bec) open source, open data, and open collaboration decks.
   - Spend a few minutes discussing the issues on your cards.
   - Nominate roles:
      - One person to take notes - we'll be reporting back afterwards!
      - A group chair / person to report back

## Report back

After about 20 minutes, each team will report back:
  - What your cards were.
  - What discussions resulted. Were there pros? cons? questions you couldn't answer?
