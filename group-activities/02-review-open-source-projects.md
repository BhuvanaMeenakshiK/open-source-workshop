# Group Exercise - contributing


- Nominate roles:
   - One person to take notes - we'll be reporting back afterwards!
   - A group chair / person to report back


##Â Find a project 

Choose a project - this could be one you know about, or one from the list below. Make a note of the following points:

1. If you wanted to contribute to them, could you figure out how?
2. Try and list things that make it easy to contribute
3. Are there any warning signs or things that could be made better?

### Some open source projects you could look at

1. [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/)
2. [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/)
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - note this is git the software, not GitHub the company!
4. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)

If none of those suit you, look through some of these umbrella sites:
5. [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/projects/current/) has many member projects
6. [Numfocus](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects) - lots of research software, mostly python/julia
7. [Software in the Public Interest](https://www.spi-inc.org/projects/)
8. [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/)
